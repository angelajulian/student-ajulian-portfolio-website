          <h2>About Angela</h2>
          <p>
            Only eight colors that you need. Only God can make a tree - but you
            can paint one. And just raise cain. Just relax and let it flow. That
            easy. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and
            it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. This is an
            example of what you can do with just a few things, a little
            imagination and a happy dream in your heart. In your world you have
            total and absolute power. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to
            Washington. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint
            him. The light is your friend. Preserve it. Those great big fluffy
            clouds. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents,
            being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your
            soul. Don't fiddle with it all day. I spend a lot of time walking
            around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little
            rabbits and stuff. <br /> Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll
            give him a little friend. When things happen - enjoy them. They're
            little gifts. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare
            them out. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. I
            like to beat the brush. Only eight colors that you need. Only God
            can make a tree - but you can paint one. And just raise cain. Just
            relax and let it flow. That easy. Every single thing in the world
            has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with
            the little rascals. This is an example of what you can do with just
            a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart.

            Those great big fluffy clouds. Exercising the imagination,
            experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are
            truly the windows to your soul. <br />Don't fiddle with it all day. I
            spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to
            trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Now we don't
            want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll
            play with clouds today. A beautiful little sunset. I really believe
            that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a
            two-inch brush. Anyone can paint. It just happens - whether or not
            you worried about it or tried to plan it. I'm going to mix up a
            little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little
            bit of Prussian Blue. Just beat the devil out of it. Now then, let's
            play. Everybody needs a friend. You want your tree to have some
            character. Make it special. Let's have a nice tree right here.
