          <h3>About Angela</h3>
          <article class="bio-text">
            Angela Julian is a life-long SF Bay Area resident, who has years of
            experience working in office and remote as a Quality Assurance
            Engineer. Let the paint work. You can't have light without dark. You
            can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. The very fact that
            you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that
            you're alive and can experience it. The light is your friend.
            Preserve it. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't
            just keep going and expect it will get better. At home you have
            unlimited time.
